# MyFyx Homework #

As part of our application process, we'd like to see what you can produce by giving you a small assignment. It should only take a few hours to complete, though any extra work that you put in will be noticed and taken into consideration.

## Project ##
We would like you to create a basic avatar managing web-app that allows users to upload and delete photos and select one to be their avatar. There should be a backend for image persistence, but you should assume a single-user system, i.e. there is no need for authentication. 

Required features:

[ ] User can upload an image
[ ] User can delete an uploaded image
[ ] User can select an uploaded image to be their "avatar"
[ ] User can view their uploaded images and their avatar, even after refreshing the page
				  
You can use any technology or framework for this project, though we prefer a [React.js](https://facebook.github.io/react/) frontend and a Node.js, Golang, or Ruby on Rails backend, as these are technologies that we use. Your frontend should use at least some Javascript, i.e. you should not just rely on server rendered static HTML and <input /> elements.  Assume the code you are writing would be going into production - make it clean, modular, and add comments where appropriate.

Some optional, extra credit features:

[ ] App is hosted somewhere (e.g. [Heroku](https://www.heroku.com/) free tier will give you a domain and compute resources)
[ ] Good user experience, styling, visual UI
[ ] Reusable components
[ ] Tests

To complete this project, please fork this repo and commit your work to your fork. You should include directions as to how to run your project in a local "dev" environemnt. When you are ready for us to review, or if you have any questions, please notify us via email.
